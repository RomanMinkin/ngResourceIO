ngResourceIO
============

Module for Angular.js framework, a factory which creates a resource object that lets interact with server-side data sources by using  [WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) as  transport layer.

The returned resource object has action methods which provide high-level behaviors without the need to interact with [WebSocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) instance directly.

Requires the ngResourceIO module to be installed.
